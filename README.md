# WORK IN PROGRESS

Programming a game engine, my ultimate quest
For I dream of games, that are truly the best
Years of hard work, I've poured into this goal
Yet the path seems endless, without any control

I know that the journey is long and winding
Know that the path ahead is steep and daunting
Absolutely, I'll keep on striving
Nothing will deter me, that's my thing
